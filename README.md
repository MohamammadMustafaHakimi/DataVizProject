# DataVizProject
I would love to find correlations between the reign of us presidents, market volatility, inflation rate, and interest rates from 1980s onwards, showcasing the economics of us in the modern era

- Project is finished, but other metrics are needed to have a better understanding of the effect of the policies implemented by each president. GDP would be an addition to this
